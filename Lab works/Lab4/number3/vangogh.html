    <center>The Starry Night is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh, 
        painted in June 1889. It depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, 
        just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village.[1][2][3] It has been in the permanent collection 
        of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941,[4] acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. Widely 
        regarded as Van Gogh's magnum opus,
         The Starry Night is one of the most recognizable paintings in Western art.</center>
